## What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?

We expect to discover and implement new libraries in our code as we analyze the data and implement new visualizations. This will involve learning new functions in ggplot2, and new data processing functions within the `tidyverse` package set.

## What major challenges do you anticipate? 

We anticipate to struggle finding novel insights in our source datasets. Purportedly, most of the data collected has already been thoroughly analyzed, so we expect to spend a decent amount of time trying to find unique research question to answer. Furthermore, in files that multiple group members are working on we expect to run in to merge conflicts, so we will rely on consistent communication to manage this problem. Finally, we also expect to struggle with cleaning and joining the datasets, which is a common problem for data collected from different sources.
