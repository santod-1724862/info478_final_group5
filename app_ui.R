            adjust our questions to focus on causes of severe accidents rather than all traffic accidents.
            The validity of looking at temperature, humidity, and associated OR/RR values may be low
            due to the dataset being taken of Kaggle and not officially collected. 
            
            The GBD data reported on the aggregate of various risk factors which may reduce the ability for insights to apply to 
            individuals. Each row reported the total death or death rate which reduced the amount of 
            calculations we could do")
